ðŸŽ® Guess the Number Game â€“ React App

This is a small fun project built with React to practice and understand core concepts of React.
The game generates a random number between 1â€“10 and the user has to guess it.
After each guess, the app shows feedback like:

â¬† Too Low â†’ if the guess is smaller

â¬‡ Too High â†’ if the guess is larger

ðŸŽ‰ Yippee! Correct â†’ if the guess matches

It also includes a Play Again (Reset) button to restart the game with a new random number.

- Conditional Rendering â†’ showing different result messages (higher/lower/correct).

- JS Logic inside React â†’ random number generation, comparisons.

- Page Refresh / State Reset â†’ using reset button with setState and optional window.location.reload().
